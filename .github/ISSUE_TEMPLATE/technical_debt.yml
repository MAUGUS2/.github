        ## üö® !IMPORTANT: Technical Debt Documentation
        
        This template follows **MAUGUS standards** for systematic technical debt management:
        - **Prevent "castelos de cartas"**: Document every shortcut and "gambiarra"
        - **Martin Fowler's Quadrant**: Classify debt type for proper treatment
        - **Business context required**: Explain WHY shortcuts were necessary
        - **Paydown plan mandatory**: Define HOW and WHEN to resolve
        - **Quality first**: Ensure debt doesn't accumulate silently
